; first way (do a b) is same as (let [_ a] b) - true in clojure. Problem here is do stmts (a) are never sampled which is
; never what you want
;
; second way (do a b) is the same as (case a b). a and b are sequenced. problem is b is not constructed until a is
; available (maybe bug). This is what we have today, may not disqualify the current behavior
;
; third way (do a b) is same as ({} a b); both are constructed at the same time and we need both to be available for the
; do expression to be available. whenever a changes, the expr changes.

  "pentagram of death - via Kenny Tilton"
  ; Key elements:
  ;  - two dependency chains from some property P leading back to one property X; and
  ;  - branching code in the derivation of P that will not travel the second dependency chain until a
  ;    certain condition is met; and
  ;  - by chance, propagation reaches P on the the first path before it reaches some intermediate property
  ;    I on the second dependency chain.
  ; The consequence is P updating once and reading (for the first time) property I, which has not yet been
  ; updated hence is inconsistent with the new value of X. This inconsistency is temporary (hence the name
  ; "glitch") because I will be updated soon enough and P will achieve consistency with X, but if one's
