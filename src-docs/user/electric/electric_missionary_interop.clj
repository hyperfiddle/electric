  ;
  ; Why?
  ; It collides with Clojure constructor syntax. At compile time, Electric must decide if (new X) should
  ; compile to a Clojure constructor call, or a flow join.
  ;
  ; Clojure core syntax:
  "Clojure constructor syntax is defined only on static classes"

  "clojure cannot construct a dynamic class with new"
  (tests (new (identity java.lang.Long) 1) :throws Exception) ; -- compile time error
  ; Syntax error (IllegalArgumentException) compiling new
  ; Unable to resolve classname: (identity java.lang.Long)

  "another way to try to construct a dynamic class with new"
  (let [Klass java.lang.Long] (new Klass 1)) ; -- compile time error
  ; Syntax error (IllegalArgumentException) compiling new

  ; See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9167457/in-clojure-how-to-use-a-java-class-dynamically
  ; todo - show that clojurescript has the same rule

  ; Therefore, Electric inverses Clojure syntax.
  ; In Clojure, dynamic class construction syntax is undefined.
  ; In Electric, dynamic class construction syntax is given meaning: join flow.
  ; By inversing Clojure syntax, this is guaranteed not to break any existing Clojure code that compiles.
