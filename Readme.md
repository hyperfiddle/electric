# Hyperfiddle Photon – a streaming Clojure/Script dialect with compiler-managed client/server datasync

Photon lets you express a frontend/backend web application as a single unified Clojure/Script expression that transcends the client/server boundary.

```clojure
(p/defn View [db state]
  (p/client
    (dom/div
      (let [email (dom/input)]
        (dom/h1 "Your orders")
        (dom/table
          (p/for [x (p/server xs (query-database db email))]
            (dom/tr (pr-str x))))))))

; Note: This is our target future syntax, we're not quite there yet.
```

It's called Photon because every point in a Photon form can be thought of as simultaneously a reactive flow and a value.

> Albert Einstein, on the wave-particle duality: *"It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do."*

# Setup
```bash
git clone ...
cd photon
clojure -T:build compile-java
yarn       # or npm install

# Sanity check that it's working:
clj -A:dev -X user/main     # healthcheck app http://localhost:8080
```

# IDE setup
Cursive:
* new deps.edn project from existing sources
* mark directory as source root (they will turn blue):
  * src-docs
  * src-dev
* Add Configuration
  * new Clojure REPL - Local
  * run with Deps
  * alias: `dev`
* Run configuration

Emacs
* ? cider-jack-in with deps alias `dev`
* ? (I think you need to run cider-jack-in with prefix argument to configure the alias?)
* None of Team Hyperfiddle is currently running emacs and there are diverse setups
* todo

# Photon Demos and tutorials

* see [src-docs/user/](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/photon/tree/master/src-docs/user) for demos and tutorials
* Start a JVM REPL and jack-in in your usual way
* App entrypoint: src-dev/[user.clj](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/photon/blob/master/src-dev/user.clj), [user.cljs](https://github.com/hyperfiddle/photon/blob/master/src-dev/user.cljs)

Please ask questions in slack! src-docs is a "cookbook" of examples and tutorials that we build in response to your questions.

# Project status = private technical alpha

Updated: 2022 May 21

Current focus is validating functionality through user trials.

May:

- [x] Photon core language at CLJ REPL
- [x] Photon core language at CLJS REPL [x] Cursive [x] Emacs [ ] Calva
- [x] Photon client/server transfer [x] Cursive [x] Emacs [ ] Calva
- [x] Photon-dom basic tutorial level usage (bugs allowed)
- [x] hot code reloading - [x] Cursive, [ ] Emacs, [ ] Calva
- [x] Photon-dom webview with client/server transfer (read only)
- [x] Photon-dom uncontrolled text input
- [x] Concurrent sessions/tabs with shared server state
- [ ] Basic Photon/Missionary interop for common patterns (buttons, ...)

June:

- [ ] photon-dom todo app (no bugs)
- [ ] tee-shirt orders example app with select options
- [ ] TodoMVC (full example) [ ] client only [ ] client/server transfer 
- [ ] Photon-dom controlled text input [ ] stabilized for network latency
- [ ] 7 GUIs [ ] cljs only [ ] client/server transfer
- [ ] Hyperfiddle staging area

July:

- [ ] client/server transfer improvements
  - [ ] reactive-for with midflight transfer - todo
  - [ ] let bindings not needlessly transferred (workaround - use dynamic bindings instead)
  - [ ] prove transfer correctness with traced IO unit tests

Q2:
- [ ] Photon idioms and component library for common patterns
- [ ] client/server transfer stress tests
- [ ] HFQL spec-driven forms with user interaction and staging area

# Known issues, gaps, gotchas

Updated: 2022 May 21

Broadly, patterns that work are documented with examples and test cases. No reference pattern = expect issues

Photon
- No fn destructuring yet (let destructuring works)
- No recursion yet, but you can hack it with dynamic lambda bindings
- No variable fn arity yet
- no clojure.core/fn inside Photon blocks yet (it is well defined)
- Current transfer syntax `~@` is challenging, you should start with a working example. Improving this is June's development priority
- Malformed programs can hang the JVM (including HFQL which is WIP)
  - Open MacOS Activity Monitor and filter by "java" to see if your JVM is hung
  - best to run with Activity Monitor open until we can mitigate it

Photon-dom
- photon-dom renders dom lists in reverse, stable dom rendering is WIP, eta May
- Pending try/catch is half baked

Photon/Missionary interop:
* The Photon/Missionary boundary is currently challenging and undocumented. 
* If you want to do something and don't see an example, please just ask us in Slack and we will provide an example. The idioms are not established yet, your intuition is unlikely to be correct! Example: "How do I connect a button click to a server callback?"
* Missionary needs a lot of work in the docs/examples/errors area. We recommend you follow working examples, otherwise ask and we will create new examples.

# Errors

* `Execution error (ClassNotFoundException) hyperfiddle.photon.Pending` - run the Clojure build step, see setup instructions
* Cursive says `Dependency cycle: hyperfiddle.api -> hyperfiddle.hfql -> hyperfiddle.hfql.impl -> hyperfiddle.api` – Cursive is not correctly handling Clojure 1.11 :as-alias, load the file form by form instead
* `clojure -T:build compile-java` error `-T is no longer supported, use -A with repl, -M for main, or -X for exec` – clojure CLI is not up to date, `brew upgrade clojure`. If you can't update, try `clojure -A:build -X build/compile-java`
