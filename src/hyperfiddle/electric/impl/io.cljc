;; Facilities for encoding/decoding of Electric protocol messages.
;; * Data frames can be arbitrary clojure data or Electric failures. Serialization is done via transit json, the failure
;; error is preserved if it's an instance of `hyperfiddle.electric.Pending` or `hyperfiddle.electric.Cancelled`, otherwise
;; the error is logged and turned into an instance of `hyperfiddle.electric.Remote`.
;; * Control frames are vectors of signed integers. Serialization is the concatenation of the binary representation of
;; these numbers as fixed-length 32-bit, big endian.
