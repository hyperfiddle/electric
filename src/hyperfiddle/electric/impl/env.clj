;; Dedicated namespace because:
;; - used by both electric compiler and HFQL
;; - non trivial logic which requires the reader to load all the knowledge in their mind
;;   Many moving parts which are easier to think about in isolation.
;;   Used to be inlined in the compiler namespace - required a lot of scrolling and navigation.


;; About ShadowCljs and Hot Code reloading:

;; By design, shadow recompiles and reload:
;; - the current saved file
;; - all direct dependents of the saved file
;; Shadow does not recompile all transitive dependents by default.

;; Shadow has a setting `:devtools {:reload-strategy :full}` which will
;; recompile and reload all transitive dependents.
;; https://code.thheller.com/blog/shadow-cljs/2019/08/25/hot-reload-in-clojurescript.html#recompile-logic

;; This actually doesn’t help us because:
;; - we are custom compiler inside of the cljs compiler compilation phase
;; - we want the current ns to recompile
;; - we want the compiler entrypoint to recompile (and rerun the electric compiler)
;; - recompiling namespaces in between the current ns and the entrypoint won’t impact the compilation.

;; This is why we need ^:dev/always on the compiler entrypoint.



;; Why did we use to need :require-macros on every namespace?

;; There are two independent memory environments:
;; - Clojure environnement — result of eval at the REPL
;; - ClojureScript compiler environnement — result of running the CLJS compiler on the codebase


;; Given this program:
;; ``` ; foo.cljc
;; (ns foo)              ; note: not using a (comment …) form for this example, ns form confuses clj-kondo
;; (def bar 1)
;; ```

;; - If loaded at the REPL, will create a `foo` ns and a `bar` var in the  Clojure environnement.
;; - If compiled by CLJS compiler, will create a `foo` ns and a `bar` var in the CLJS compiler environment.


;; The following program will create `foo` and `bar` in both environments. There
;; will be two `foo` and two `bar`.

;; ``` ; foo.cljc
;; (ns foo #?(:cljs (:require-macros [foo])))
;; (def bar 1)
;; ```

;; => The electric compiler always resolves vars on the peer defined by
;; `e/client` or `e/server`. But `e/def` is a special case and should be
;; resolved in either environnement no matter the peer.


;; When a e/server block is analyzed, it resolves symbols to check if they are
;; macros or e/defs. Vars needs to be loaded in the Clojure Environnement JVM
;; side to be resolvable. :require-macros trigger a clojure `require
;; ns :reload`, loading vars into the Clojure environnement. Instead of
;; requiring users to write :require-macros in every ns, the electric compiler
;; can call `require` just before resolving a var in a clojure ns. This
;; requiring strategy only requires the ns if necessary (if the corresponding
;; source file has been touched).


;; How to resolve an alias:
;; - Server
;;   - try to resolve a clj alias definition (might be behind a #?:clj flag)
;;     - this requires loading the current clj namespace
;;   - try to resolve a cljs alias (we might be in cljs file within an e/server block)
;;   - try to resolve a cljs macro alias (require-macros)
;; - Client
;;   - try to resolve a cljs alias
;;   - try to resolve a cljs macro alias (require-macros)


;; How to resolve a var:
;; - Server
;;   - try to resolve a cljs macro var
;;     - if macro found in cljs compiler state, return macro var
;;       - only if it’s not a twin var
;;   - otherwise
;;     - resolve symbol alias based on
;;       - cljs compiler current ns info
;;       - if not found, retry based ond resolved current clojure namespace
;;     - find target ns fully qualified name
;;     - call `(require target-ns :reload)` if necessary
;;     - find var in target ns
;; - Client
;;   - try to resolve symbol in cljs compiler state
;;   - otherwise, try to resolve a macro var in cljs compiler state
;;   - if var is a local binding var (yes this exists), return nil
;;   - try to find a twin clojure var (e.g. inc)
;;     - if it exists, return it (why is it needed)
;;     - otherwise return current found var


;; How to resolve a runtime symbol:
;; - Server
;;   - resolve the var
;;     - if var is a macro, or an e/def -> return nil
;;     - otherwise return the fully qualified var name
;; - Client
;;   - if it resolves to a cljs var or clj class
;;     - return the fully qualified symbols
;;   - if it resolves to a clj var (twin var)
;;    - return the cljs var (not twin clj var) fully qualified name


;; GG: Abstraction on resolved vars.
;;     A symbol may resolve to:
;;     - nil
;;     - a cljs var description (a map)
;;     - a cljs macro var description (a map)
;;     - a clojure var (clojure.lang.Var)
;;       - which can be a twin of a cljs var (e.g. cljs.core/inc has two versions: a cljs runtime function and a clj macro)
;;     - a JVM Class
